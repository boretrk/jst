; I've written this script a long time ago to decrunch all files of a given
; directory, recursively.
;
; if files are XPK packed this will allow JST to run
;
; be careful, though, as xfddecrunch will decrunch packed files that aren't XPK so
; you can't use it twice on a directory. Also only use when JST reports that files are packed
;
; (some games use RNC or other packers that xfddecrunch supports, that could break the game)

echo > t:dcr "failat 20"
list {DIRECTORY} LFORMAT "xfddecrunch >NIL: *"%f%s*"" ALL >> t:dcr
execute t:dcr
delete t:dcr QUIET
