General:

- resload_ReadJoyPort limitations: 1) not cached against multiple quick reads and 2) mouse not supported (yet?)
- address error (and possibly others like illegal instruction...) are forwarded to the program instead of
  being intercepted by JST exception layer in relocated VBR (ex: Universe: g 1 => universe custom guru screen)
- add NoMemReverse (not very useful)
- set CUSTOM flags to all ones when joypad buttons are pressed, like in CD32load
- add quit with middle mouse button: Check DATLX bit in POTGOR, i.e. btst #8-8,$dff016 does the trick. 
- to improve: if file is written to within existing filecache (no size increase) and HDLOAD/LOWMEM not set, then write into filecache and flags
  the file as "dirty" so the new version is written on exit (like whdload does). Allows games to save to big diskfiles (kickemu/no files)
  quickly. Without this, it just takes too long when writing several sectors of the disk because the whole file is written (and there are
  OS swaps as well)
- running from workbench/icon seems to be broken from kickstart 1.3. It hasn't been tested a lot recently.
- TODO: TST regs on whdload calls (to set condition codes properly)
- do more tests on savegames (Faery Tale Adventure, Universe, others...) as file writes seem to be
  far from perfect
- support QUITKEY=0 (currently ignored)
- if JOYPAD=2 is set and joystick is in port 1, then enable joypad=1 and copy params from 1 to 0
- if JOYPAD=0 and try to set JOY1PLAY... option, bail out, 1= + JOY0PLAY the same!!
- kick1.3 joypad options (currently it works but there's no way to change default values, maybe env. variables?)
- adapt the documentation for older version (guide)
- ExNext emulation is missing (not possible to scan a directory under kickemu slaves)
- Examine/GetFileSize only work if the file is in cache (so not with LOWMEM/HDLOAD). That will probably stay like this
- A lot of integer instructions aren't emulated on a 68060 (compared to whdload extensive emulation): Speedball 2 doesn't work on 060

The compatibility with WHDload is now very good but there are still some games crashing:

- Worms DC crashes
- Speedball 2 (68060) unsupported integer instruction. WHDload 68060 emulation is very complete. The one in JST is minimal (MOVEP)
  Maybe it would be possible to patch each game which uses those instructions instead.
- Seems to have trouble with Kickstart 1.1 or its RTB table (7 cities of gold)

Faery Tale Adventure:

from the icon :
- when the game is quitted -> GURU 00000008.002274C8
(crash occurs only if launched from the icon. Game can be quitted nicely if launched from shell.)

from the icon & from the shell :
- music & scrolling are slow when the character is moved on the screen
- when attempting to save the game -> black screen (and nothing more). After a reset, and a re-launch of the game, the position saved can be loaded.

Universe (only from Kick1.3?):

from the icon (only, as it is working if the game is launched from the shell) :
- when attempting to save the game -> black screen (and nothing more). After a reset, and a re-launch of the game, the position saved can be loaded.

General advice for low memory users:

- you can use LOWMEM, but sometimes it's not possible because there's not enough memory to save the OS so JST is able to
  swap memory to load more files.
- if you can't use LOWMEM, you can still omit it, but then you may run out of file preloading memory... Oh damn..., but
  in some cases, the slave can use files that can be packed (using ProPack), reducing the preloading memory. For instance
  silkworm can run on 1MB total mem (no quit possible) if files are packed.
  (note: XPK packing doesn't count and is anyway not supported, but useless here: the unpacking would occur before game
  is started, so it doesn't help memory-wise)
