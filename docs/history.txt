v6.4 (29.10.2020)

- improved: kickstart 1.3 users without fast memory can run games now,
  resident JST code & game data are now relocated on top of memory
- whdload mode: quitkey resets the machine when chip memory could not be backuped

v6.3 (03.10.2020)

- improved: implemented stop/start for cdtv cd-rom drive if present

v6.2

- fixed: 2nd button joystick buttonpress bug
- improved: setting JOY1xx or JOY0yy option automatically enables JOYPAD proper settings
- improved: added JOYPAD tooltype. This isn't perfect, as it enables both joypads

v6.1 (01.07.2018):

- fixed: resload_GetCustom now returns TRUE instead of FALSE (Bloodwych works)
- fixed: slave name truncation issue (kickstart 1.3)
- fixed: resload_GetFileSizeDec now returns decrunched size instead of 0 (Slamtilt works)
- fixed: built-in quitkey was completely broken (so 68000 users couldn't use it properly)
- fixed: CUSTOM1=>5 tooltypes are now active (forgot to implement that, sorry!), so conditional patchlists (trainers) are working now
- fixed: resload_Decrunch RNC uses its own stack (could crash some low-stack usage games when data files were RN-packed)
- fixed: reload_GetFileSize/GetFileSizeDec now test D0 before returning (some slaves only tested CCR), Flashback works
- fixed: JOYPAD=3 works properly now to redirect buttons to keys for both joysticks
- fixed: Kickstart 3.1 support is working now
- fixed: loadkick used data directory so there was a fatal RTB load error when DATA= option was used
- fixed: saving to disk/creating new files (savegames) was very buggy, since the start of JST I guess. Still bugs, though
- fixed: resload_GetFileSize now returns a valid value
- fixed: kick crc mismatch (with legacy resload_LoadKick function) fixed
- fixed: kick 1.3 command line argument parsing was broken
- improved: kick 1.3 master read of QUITKEY environment variable
- improved: if a normal joystick is plugged in, it's detected as such (the second button is supported if there's one,
  and you still have the other joypad for pause+ESC if you don't have a keyboard, default mapping for PAUSE & FWD+BWD
  made the same for both players). Also, all R+B+G+Y+pause buttons quit the game from both joypads now.
- improved: display game quit key / env. variable QUITKEY to override game quit key (Kick 2.0+ only)
- improved: cache flush better interrupt disabling
- improved: resload_SetCACR partially implemented (only flushed the caches before)
- improved (TBC): freezing interrupts when using resload_DiskLoad. This allows to make SWIV run. How the game runs with whdload
  or cd32load without freezing the interrupts is a mystery...

v6.0 (2017 xmas edition) features:

- set JOYPAD=1,2,3 to enable joypad0, joypad1 or both and the JOYxyyy options to redirect buttons to keyboard
- added JOY1BLUE/K, ... options to emulate keyboard from a CD32 joypad
- fixed long-time double loading/memory bug for diskfiles with whdload
- improved hex2string so quitkey accepts 0x prefix for hex
- fixed: old bug: no more random lockups on startup
- whdload compatibility: added resload_Examine support so kickemu/kickfs games can work
- whdload mode: diskfiles where loaded as disks & files: fixed
- whdload compatibility: added support for TPWM unpacker in resload_Decrunch, removed some exotic packers
  like Fungus (gremlin), FIRE decrunch, and others.
- whdload compatibility: RNC decrunch detects old or new versions: Rodland whdload now works
- whdload compatibility: cache flush added in the end of resload_Decrunch
- whdload compatibility: added better support for resload_Relocate (backported from CD32Load)
- whdload compatibility: added support for resload_PatchSeg (backported from CD32Load)
- whdload compatibility: added more command support to reload_Patch/PatchSeg (backported from CD32Load)
- whdload compatibility: added CUSTOMx switches & conditional patchlists (backported from CD32Load)
- whdload compatibility: support for V15 & V16 functions: FORCEWHD has been removed
- whdload compatibility: LoadKick & kickstart emulation now support BCPL relocation as well
- changed LOADDIR parameter/tooltype to DATA (matches whdload)
- XPK pack is not supported but at least now it's detected before running the game and there's an error message
- removed FORCEWHD, NOOSSWAP, SNOOPCUSTOM, SAVEDIR options
- Better error message when DATA directory is not found
- renamed USERDATA to CUSTOM to match whdload switches
- PRELOAD now cancels HDLOAD & LOWMEM. But preloading is set by default, unlike whdload

New v5.0 (beta) Features:

- works with 68000/kick1.3 (tested with WinUAE)
- For Kickstart 1.3, command line options are:
  SLAVE,USERDATA/K,LOADDIR/K,EXECUTE/S,NOQUIT/S,NTSC/S,PAL/S,QUITKEY/K,TRAINER/S,PRELOAD/S,QUIET/S,NOCACHE/S,NOFAST/S,
  JOYPAD/S,HDLOAD/S,LOWMEM/S,DELAY/S,BUTTONWAIT/S,LEAVECACHES/S,NOTRAPHANDLER/S,TEST/S,VERBOSE/S,
  NOVBRMOVE/S
- fixed a long-time bug in whdload emulation, that allows 68000/ECS CPUs to run slaves
- added partial WHDLoad V15 compatibility (patchlist commands). You'll need FORCEWHD option (ex: Project-X SE, Lotus 2)
- also works with high-end CPUs, just like the previous v4 versions, with their problems (MMU stuff is not so great, locks up
  the console the second time you run from it, and all the reasons that made me give up JST in the first place...)

Example of use:

jst robocop.slave data=data
jst battlesquadron.slave

Limitations (I won't do anything to fix them):

- In kick1.3, LOADDIR will also set SAVEDIR (JST-only feature) to avoid confusion. It was not such a good idea to separate LOAD & SAVE directories...
  => in case of problems, just put all data files in the .slave directory, and avoid LOADDIR
- XPK pack is not supported: please decrunch all XPK data files/diskfiles before using

Limitations (I'll try to fix them):

- some WHDLoad slaves crash/lockup: report them, I'll try to do something
- os swaps lock the machine: ex: when saving hi-scores
- on kick 2.0+, sometimes quitting a game means you cannot run JST again from this console. You need to open another one. There must be
  a resource freeing bug/leak somewhere: workaround: open another console (it works fine each time on kickstart 1.3!!!)
- most WHDLoad kickstart-emulated games / kickfs won't work
